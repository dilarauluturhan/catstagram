> This project is a social media site. I used frontend and backend technology in this project. My sector is frontend development and i used backend technology for the first time. Applications i have implemented in this project: React.js, Bootstrap 5, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDb. I've added the ability to create user register, user login, get a user's profile photo, and share a post to this project.
